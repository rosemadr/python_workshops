# print("3+3") putting a '#' means this line is a comment, it's contents will be ignored
# print(3+3) 
string1 = "Hello Sue" #this is a string

float1 = 4.3 # this is a float - floating point number/decimal
bool1 = True # this is a boolean - True or False

# print(type(string1))
print(3+3)  # because 3 is an integer this will give 6
print("Hello" + "World")  # because "Hello" and "World" are strings +  will concatenate them to make "HelloWorld" 

# Python is a high level, interpreted and dynamically typed programming language
# high level means its closer to human language
# interpreted (rather than compiled)
# dynamically typed language means python will infer what data type a variable is, you do not have to declare it
